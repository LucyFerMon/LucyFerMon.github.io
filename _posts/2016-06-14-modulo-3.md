# Manipulating data and making maps

GIS is easy in R. Today we're going to use maps to visually explore a (fake) census dataset.

# Preparation  

Please download this dataset, and save it as "census.csv" on your computer (ie, don't change the name!)
[http://cismr.com/census.csv](http://cismr.com/census.csv)

Please install the "raster" package by running:

<pre>
install.packages('raster')
</pre>
