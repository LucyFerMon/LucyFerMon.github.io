                <p>We're not a company. We're just a couple of health researchers.</p>
                <p>We think that papers and presentations in are field are boring. Which sucks, since they're usually about really cool stuff.</p>
                <p>We want to create beautiful visualizations and presentations. And we want to share our techniques and discoveries.</p>
